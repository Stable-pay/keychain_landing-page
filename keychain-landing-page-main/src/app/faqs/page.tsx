            </h1>
            <p className="text-xs md:text-sm text-[#8E8E93]">
              A Keychain payment link is a simple URL (link) that you can
              generate in the Keychain app and share with anyone via email or
              messaging apps like WhatsApp, text messages, or chat. It contains
              all the information needed for them to receive the money you're
              sending. Just share the link, and they can collect the fundsâ€”it's
              as simple and as magical as that!

                  important to note that on-ramp partners are third-party
                  services, and we do not control their fees or transaction
                  times. The time it takes for your funds to reflect in your

              Absolutely! You can change your native currency to your preferred

              currency, ensuring a seamless experience.

              Yes, Keychain prioritizes your security. We use advanced

              What Happens If I Send Funds to the Wrong Recipient?
            </h1>
            <p className="text-xs md:text-sm text-[#8E8E93]">
              With blockchain technology, transactions are irreversible, much
              like giving someone physical cash. Once you send funds, they can
              only be retrieved if the recipient chooses to send them back to
              you. So, it's crucial to double-check the recipient's details
              before making a transaction to ensure it goes to the right person.
